- export DISPLAY=:0.0
	- sets display to local machine
	- must be entered exacly as is (no space on either side of '=' symbol
- /sbin/shutdown -r now
	- initiate computer shutdown sequence
- ln -s <physical> <virtual>
	- create a symlink (pointing to <virtual file> will act on <actual file>)
- add shell-scripts to ~/_repos/bin to enable them as global commands
	- this works because a symlink has been created between ~/bin and ~/_repos/bin
- sudo rm /var/crash/* - gets rid of all "system program problem detected" pop ups
